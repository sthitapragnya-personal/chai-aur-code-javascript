// in js the interpreter(software) was present inside the browser, and for that reason we used to write a html file and then add script tag inside the html file then open it in browser and then we would go to the console and there we used to run the js codes

// but yes in recent times that interpreter or that software was dittached from the browser and now we can run the js codes independently

//so we need to search for node.js and download it and install it and once it is installed we can then run for node filename.js and we can see the output in the terminator in the vscode

// similary we can also use the Deno.js

// to run the code open terminal(ctrl+`)
// and then write node -v to check the verion of the Node.js
// next to run it use node test.js

//next topic is github but we already know this and i went through the video on this topic nothing new
